# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for considering contributing! 🎉 We welcome bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions. This document outlines how to get involved and what we expect so collaboration stays smooth and respectful.



## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute by:

* Reporting bugs
* Suggesting features or enhancements
* Improving documentation
* Writing or refactoring code
* Reviewing pull requests

If you’re unsure where to start, look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

## Getting Started 

[Wiki Example]
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Koyot-Digital/Wiki.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your change

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Install dependencies and run the project locally (see `README.md`)

## Development Workflow

* Keep changes focused and scoped
* Write clear, readable code
* Add or update tests when applicable
* Update documentation if behavior changes

Please rebase your branch on the latest `main` before opening a pull request.

## Commit Messages

We prefer clear, descriptive commit messages:

* Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Keep the first line under 72 characters
* Reference issues when relevant (e.g. `Fixes #123`)

Example:

```
Add validation for user input

Fixes #42
```

## Pull Requests

When opening a pull request:

* Explain **what** you changed and **why**
* Link related issues
* Include screenshots or logs if relevant
* Ensure all checks pass

Pull requests may be reviewed for:

* Correctness
* Readability and maintainability
* Test coverage
* Alignment with project goals

Please be patient—reviews may take some time.

## Style Guides

* Follow existing code style and patterns
* Run linters/formatters if provided
* Avoid unnecessary refactors unrelated to your change

If the project uses a specific style guide, it will be documented in the `README.md` or a dedicated config file.

## Testing

* Add tests for new features or bug fixes when possible
* Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting
* Include steps to manually verify behavior if automated tests aren’t feasible

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include:

* A clear and descriptive title
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Expected vs actual behavior
* Environment details (OS, version, browser, etc.)

Use the bug report issue template if available.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:

* Describe the problem you’re trying to solve
* Explain your proposed solution
* Mention any alternatives you’ve considered

This helps maintainers evaluate scope and fit.

## Documentation

Documentation improvements are always appreciated.

* Fix typos or unclear explanations
* Add examples where helpful
* Keep tone clear and friendly

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as this project.
