# GitHub Standards

## Readability
When you make changes to the wiki you must make sure you comment on your work/code and when making a commit you must say what you have changed in the commit clearly. Speak like your giving an action. E.g. Add {feature}, Remove {feature} etc.

## Branches
When working on a feature make sure to make a new branch for this so you do not commit directly into the main branch. You must do your work in your branch and when it is ready for production you may make a pull request to merge it into the main branch. Only the creator of the branch should make pull requests for the branch

## Other
Keep it to one change per commit. Make sure not to make a bunch of unrelated changes in one commit. If your commit is about organizing files organize them then when you do the next thing make that in another commit. In other words make sure your commit are related.


As Stated in the sections provided failure to adhere to these rules may result in moderation or removal of the contributor status.
